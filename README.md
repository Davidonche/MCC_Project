The Capital Marginal Cost Project is an open source repository for the crowdsourced effort in quantitatively registering the cost/return on capital as a function of capital itself.

## A Discussion on Capital's Nature



Largely determined by the presence or absence of competition. 
Instead of making it its **main objective**, to guarantee competition as the fundamental objective of capitalism, it is **assumed** to be, and on top of this a series of remedies are prescripted for increasingly *unexplicable* maladies.

Thus, as so often has been the case throughout history, the burden of proof has been taken from the shoulders of doctrine and put onto the scientific and the brotherly to break through. 

## The Project

The interest rate being the cost/return on Capital itself, makes it the indicator par excelence on the access/performance differentials of the latter. 

However, any other indicator that precisely, correctly, and markedly reflects this dynamic is another potent argument

Being an heterodox argument, the Capital Marginal Cost Project
