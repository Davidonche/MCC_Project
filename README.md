The Marginal Cost on Capital Project is an open source repository for the crowdsourced effort in quantitatively registering the cost/return on capital as a function of capital itself.

## A Discussion on Capital's Nature

An iron truth evident to all but the staunchest of psyche defense mechanisms, is the reality of the cumulative nature of capital. Whether it is a children of *luck*
being able to learn a 3rd language for free thanks to its trust-fund sponsored vacation overseas, or a young waitress developing costly medical conditions and
eventually dropping her education while providing for her family, the implacable way in which **having** propels to the top and **lacking** drags one down, has only
been ignored in the economic discussion through the most monumental efforts. 



Largely determined by the presence or absence of competition. 
Instead of making it its **main objective**, to guarantee competition as the fundamental objective of capitalism, it is **assumed** to be, and on top of this a series of remedies are prescripted for increasingly *unexplicable* maladies.

One of the reasons is the difficulty of 
It should be pointed out that the naturaly accumulative nature of Capital hasnÂ´t been systematically refuted ever, either. That Capital is just as easy to accure for the wealthy as for the pauper is just assumed as another axiom since the 80's devolution. Thus, as so often has been the case throughout history, the burden of proof has been taken from the shoulders of doctrine and put onto the scientific and the brotherly to break through. 

## The Project

The interest rate being the cost/return on Capital itself, makes it the indicator par excelence on the access/performance differentials of the latter. 

But even if somehow paliated by stronger welfare, and the very capital abundance vis-a-vis the developing world, the developed countries are no less subject to this dynamic throughout their economic stratas: while the top decile and behemont oligopolies enjoy the marvels of hyper-low interest rates, those with nothing but their income from labour are offered vastly different terms of credit. Indeed, whether its the sanctioned financial institutions' market rate for the general public and SMEs, or the loan-sharks' rate to which they are thrown by the credit rating system, financing the same single dollar is much costlier for those without Capital to begin with, than for those congested with it. It is extremely important to point out this is not an abherration of the system, but an unintended demonstration of Capital's dynamics inscribed fundamentaly in the economic system by design. Indeed the financial system allocates resources according to risk forecasts, it just so happens it is the first to acknowleadge the main factor behind Capital accumulation is Capital possession.

However, any other indicator that precisely, correctly, and markedly reflects this dynamic is another potent argument in what has be an overwhelming final mountain of
evidence. 

In this regard, more than enough constructive criticism will be crowdsourced for free to the challenged dogma, ~~as a payment for bearing the burden of proof~~. Being an
arguably contentious subject, the MCC_Project will certainly be subject to abundant criticism if anything, so peer review is not the most immediate concern.
