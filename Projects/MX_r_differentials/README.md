# Mexico's commercial banking loan balances as a function of interest rate, per client type

It is an open secret in the financial sector that credit terms are worlds appart depending on the socioeconomic strata. The topics of middle class income collapse[^4], inequality[^5], and the nature of Capital[^6] have risen again to prominence recently. But even here, the inherent self-nurturing nature of wealth is just fleetingly mentioned, when not only is the income inequality from assets much bigger than that from labour, but the top decile hoards most stock while the bottom half has a negative income:debt ratio[^7].

On the other side of the coin, unlimited access to capital in ZIRP-age terms may incentivize not only *moral hazard* and punish long-term investment[^2], but protects mediocrity in such a way, that 1 in 10 publicly listed conglomerates in the developed world had an interest coverage ratio less than 1, as far as 2018[^3], and during the very ZIRP period. 

It is in this context, that the discussion on the marginal cost of Capital as a function of wealth itself, can not be postponed anymore.

## A feedback relationship

Indeed, rather than an anomaly or abherration, the self-reinforcing dynamics of wealth accumulation and scarcity seem to be further engraved in the resource allocation system of capitalism, then the latter is understood as inherently meritocratic instead of critically dependent on real competition. With both the GINI and Herfindahl-Hirschmann Indexes surging beyond levels not seen since exactly a Century ago, if this characteristic of Capital holds any truth, it can only increase exponentially the urgency and dire of the international economy.
